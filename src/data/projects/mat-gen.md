image_source: "/res/images/matgen_thumbnail.png"
description: "A method that utilizes a pre-trained monocular generative intrinsic image estimator to distill Physically Based Rendering material textures for room scale scenes. Given the scene geometric mesh and a set of images spatially covering the environment, our model synthesizes albedo, roughness, metallic, normal and irradiance maps using score distillation"
