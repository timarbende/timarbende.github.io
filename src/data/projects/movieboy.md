short_description: "An iOS application using SwiftUI and the OMDb API for movie or show recommendations, with ability to search by genre, actors, production team, etc. Supports favoriting, darkmode and similar movie recommendations"
long_description: "An native iOS application built with SwiftUI providing media recommendations powered by the TheMovieDB API. Both movies and TV shows have a user-friendly home page with the latest and best recommendations, but they can also be individually searched by title. Clicking on a piece of media opens the details page with description, cast and other relevant movies or shows. Furthermore, the app lets the user save their favourites and lists them on a separate page. A fully integrated dark mode ensures a modern user experience consistent with iOS design standards. \n \n The app was built with SwiftUI using the Human Interface Guidelines. Its architecture follows the MVVM principles. Furthermore the project demonstrates practical API integration, asynchronous data fetching, state management in SwiftUI, and the design of a scalable architecture for content-driven mobile applications."
