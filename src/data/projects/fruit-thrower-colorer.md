description: "An iOS augmented reality game leveraging ARKit body tracking and physics-based trajectory calculation. The aim of the game is to hit people in the view of your phone camera with fruits using a flick of your finger. Hitting a person colors the hit part of their body with the color of the fruit. Aim for the high score by hitting as many people as possible - different body parts are worth differing points!"
