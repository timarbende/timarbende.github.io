short_description: "An iOS augmented reality game leveraging ARKit body tracking and physics-based trajectory calculation. The aim of the game is to hit people in the view of your phone camera with fruits using a flick of your finger. Hitting a person colors the hit part of their body with the color of the fruit. Aim for the high score by hitting as many people as possible - different body parts are worth differing points!"
long_description: "Fruit Thrower Colorer is an iOS augmented reality game that leveraging ARKit to integrate real-time body tracking. The game tracks the joints of people's bodies in three dimensions by using the camera on the device to identify them in the surroundings. With a flick gesture, players can launch virtual fruits, and the trajectory is determined by physically based motion to produce predictable and enjoyable throws. \n \n The object of the game is to hit as many tracked players as you can in the alotted time. With every successful hit, the affected body part is dynamically colored with the color of the fruit, giving instant visual feedback and strengthening the link between virtual and physical interaction. Because different body parts are given varying point values, strategic aiming and accuracy are encouraged instead of haphazard throwing. \n \n Feel free to reach out if you are interested in this project!"
