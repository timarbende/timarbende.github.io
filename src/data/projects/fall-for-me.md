long_description: "This is the project of my Master's Praktikum for Informatics: Games Engineering in the Technical University of Munich. \n \n Fall for Me is a local-multiplayer platform fighter inspired by classics such as Super Smash Bros. and Brawlhalla. To put a twist on the genre the gameplay takes place on a procedurally generated roller coaster with lifelike dynamics constantly speeding up and slowing down the coaster based on curvature. Instead of pushing the opponent down from the roller coaster, the aim is to collect as many candy as possible in the time-limit, by safely depositing it at the regular checkpoints. Both punching, kicking and long-range attacks are powerful thanks to snappy controls. A very hectic, chaotic and competitive experience where no two rounds are identical thanks to the constant environment hazards. \n \n The playful level design is elevated by our hand-drawn art-style and custom-composed music, giving it a cheerful identity. \n \n Feel free to reach out if you are interested in this project!"
