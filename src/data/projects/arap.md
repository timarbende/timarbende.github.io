description: "A C++ re-implementation of the As-Rigid-As-Possible mesh deformation technique from Sorkine et al. The aim is to preserve local geometry of the mesh by minimizing the deviations of individual cells from rigid body transformations. Included is a report detailing related work, the methods used for the algorithm, our results, conclusion and possible future work."
