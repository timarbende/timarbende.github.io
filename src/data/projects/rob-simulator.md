long_description: "Rob Simulator is a short Virtual Reality game with a primary focus on emphasizing industry-standard VR interaction and guidance techniques for elevating user experience in immersive environments; such as landmarking, light emphasis, view-tunneling multi-optional interactability to encourage flexible problem-solving in a comfortable VR experience. \n \n In the game, the player breaks into a house with the objective of acquiring valuable items within a limited time. The entire environment is interactable: chairs can be lifted, doors can be opened and moved naturally, and even small objects like sticky notes can be picked up and placed freely. Mission progress is embedded into the world on a number of surfaces: the remaining time can be checked on a wristwatch, the total value of collected items is displayed on the living room TV, and a radar device left behind by the homeowner helps locate valuables more efficiently. By combining systemic interaction design with thoughtful UX techniques, the project demonstrates both technical implementation in Unity and human-centered design principles tailored specifically for virtual reality. \n \n The project targets the Meta Quest devices.
