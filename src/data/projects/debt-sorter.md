title: "Debt Sorter"
short_description: "Native android app for organizing debts between friends using Kotlin and the legacy View system, and Huawei Mobile Services. \n \n 🎉2nd Place winner 🥈 on the Mobile Development Competition by Honor and Budapest University of Technology and Economics 2021 🎉"
long_description: "DebtSorter is an award-winning Android application designed to simplify financial tracking within social circles. By integrating a custom friend-request system, the app allows users to seamlessly assign debts and receivables to contacts while monitoring their overall financial health through interactive, data-driven charts. \n \n Developed using Kotlin and the Android View system, the project served as a technical showcase for the Honor Mobile Services (HMS) ecosystem. It leveraged Honor’s cloud infrastructure for secure data persistence and push-notification handling to handle real-time user connectivity. \n \n While currently preserved as a legacy project, it remains a primary example of my ability to build cloud-integrated MVPs and implement vendor-specific SDKs under competitive pressure."
